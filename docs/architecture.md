## Event Routing

 -  Events which are not "captured" keep getting routed to other elements.

WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY 

THINKING
 - partially autonomous element model. (suzerainty?)
   - the local loc/visibility is controlled by the element
     - this is not the abs location, only the location within the immediate
       context.
   - this introduces a bit of confusion with regards to mouse event positions. 
     - mouse position events are local (upper right is 0, 0) 
     - could create a new position type and send that in with the crossterm mouse
       event 

 - DynLocation change hooks?
   - elements could setup interdependancies around scaling
   - how to deal with inf.recurrsion?? NOT AN ISSUE
     - if two elements want to have a common edge.
       - eg. element 1 shifts, triggering element 2 which shifts, which triggers
         element 1 which doesn't change as it's already in the correct position. 
 - DONT DO Move DynLocationSet back to the responses?
   - would need to first create widget builders which actually need the location
