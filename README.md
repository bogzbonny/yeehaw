yeehaw was born out of a need for an adaptable design for sophisticated text
based applications, with the goal of presenting as much information as cleanly
as possible. 

# Reasons why you want your application as text-based

1) It's the only way you'll ever be cool again
2) They're rapidly iterable
3) They're distraction free
4) They're conceptually simple, it's just a grid 
5) You're server-side WebUIs are centralized and weak as shit
