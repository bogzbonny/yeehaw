01. make the element-id a name (string) which is unique across the entire cui application.
     - the element-id will nolonger be assigned by each element organizer, but
       assigned to each element at it's creation. 
     - a global object called sorting_hat will assign each elements name at
       instantiation. 
     - the sorting_hat object will name elements based on element_type. 
01. Kitty issue: when resizing a lot, there are some artifacts
01. wezterm issue, at larger sizes, there are flashy rendering issues. 
     - likely has to do with that all drawCh (even hidden ones) are sent during
       render, so it IS forced to render all hidden elements, then rerender the
       upper layer, rather than just rendering the highest layer.
01. textbox horizontal bar not working when wordwrap disabled (doesn't enable
    itself)
01. horizontal scrollbar dragging not working (vertical is though) 
     - clicking still working
01. textbox  right-arrow wont get you to the last FINAL extra cursor position of the text. 
    - however the down arrow can get you there
01. refactors
     - create SclLocationSet type
     - modify EO to use SclLocationSet instead of LocationSet (everything
       dynamic on context) 
     - move 'SclLocation' to the element from the EO  
        - will need to remove pos_x, pos_y, width, height from Pane
     - move 'visible' to the element from the EO
     - remove unnecessary element event response items now that the location 
       and visibility are a part of the element

##[2302-2202] Buggy Y positioning for RCM in multipanes

When two WidgetPanes are in a MultiPane (vertpanes) and the bottom one is right
clicked, the RCM appears in the correct x position but the incorrect y position.

refer to cui/examples/issue_manager/main.rs


##[2302-2201] WidgetPane in StackPanes bleeding out of bounds

When focus of a MultiPane is shifted to a pane containing a WidgetPane, any
widgets with a size greater than that dictated by the MultiPane will bleed out
of the bounds of the multipane.

The widget should be cut off instead.


##[2302-1302] - Rename All instances of CBA in the codebase to CBA
AFFECTED FILES: Lots of them

##[2302-1301] - Pane Control Commands Not Registering Properly In StackPanes
AFFECTED FILES: PaneHorizontalStd.rs, PaneVerticalStd.rs

In certain situations, the pane command key combos (Ctrl+Ww, Ctrl+WW, etc) are
not being registered correctly.
Example! cui/examples/issue_manager/main.rs
Given:
- Main element is SHP
- SHP has two panes: WidgetPane & SVP. SVP contains two WidgetPanes
         SHP
          │
 ┌────────┴─────────┐
 │                  │
  ┌───────┬────────┐
  │       │        │ ─┐
  │       │  WP2   │  │
  │ WP1   │        │  │
  │       ├────────┤  ├─ SVP
  │       │  WP3   │  │
  │       │        │ ─┘
  └───────┴────────┘
- the WP1 starts in focus
- Pressing Ctrl+Ww moves to WP2
- Pressing Ctrl+WW moves to WP1
- Pressing Ctrl+Ww or Ctrl+WW will do nothing as they have been deregistered
  from the CUI.EO.Prioritizer

it seems as though, when initially moving from WP1 to WP2, the pane controls for
the SVP are not propagated up to the CUI.EO. But when moving back to WP1 from
WP2, the pane controls for the SHP (Which were never properly registered) are
properly deregistered from the CUI.EO. But since they were never initially
added, the ones being removed are actually for the SHP, which can now no longer
receive the commands, even though it still has them as SelfEvs

I suspect this issues is arising somewhere near
StackPanes.ChangeFocusToNextPane() in regards to the IC that is being returned 

it appears to be that, when the SHP changes focus from the SVP to WP1, the change in
inputability to the SVP is propagated all the way up to the CUI.EO. At that
point, while processing the IC, the CUI.EO will remove ALL instances of the pane
control combos in its prioritizer as all of them are registered to its only
child - the SHP. And since WP1 isn't registering any pane
control combos, the CUI.EO winds up with no registered pane control combos.

a potential solution would be for a ParentPane to check if any of the
InputabilityChanges removals overlap with the ParentPane's selfEvs and then send
those along as additions to be re-added after the removals have stripped all
matching events from the grandparent's prioritizer. 

This would be fairly straightforward to accomplish for StackPanes by doing it in
ChangeFocusToPane but that wouldn't solve the problem for any ParentPane.
Actually, ChangeFocusToPane is built on top of ChangePriorityForEl which is a
method of ParentPane. 

mp.ChangeFocusToPane() 
   -> mp.Focus/UnfocusPane() 
         -> pp.ChangePriorityForEl() 
               -> pp.EO.ChangePriorityForEl()

ParentPane could look through the IC returned by EO.ChangePriorityForEl, check
the RmRecEvs for matches to ParentPane.SelfEvs and update the IC.AddRecEvs
accordingly.

##[2211-2202] - Think about Adding OverallPriority to Pane
DON'T IMPLEMENT
AFFECTED FILES: pane.rs

- SEPARATE from priorities of keystrokes and commands
- wouldn't affect prioritizers
- would be useful in situation of HorizontalPanes

##[2211-2200] - Priority Panic
AFFECTED FILES: ParentPanes.rs, HorizontalPanes.rs, VerticalPanes.rs

- create parameter whereby at the start of the CUI the multipanes can determine
  their logic for dealing with 2 evs registered at the same priority. default
  could be just send to the first one. second would be panicking if two were
  registered as the same

##[2211-2201] - Standard vs Basic StackPanes
AFFECTED FILES: HorizontalPanes.rs, VerticalPanes.rs

- create StandardHorizontalPanes & StandardVerticalPanes, extended from
  HorizontalPanes & VerticalPanes, respectively.
- Standard versions should have built in logic for switching panes
- add open pane paramater - ElementID that tracks current OPEN pane
- add events for switching panes (Ctrl+W, w, j, k, etc)

##[2211-2100] - Command Restructure 
AFFECTED FILES: Many Elements

Change the the commandEl to take in the CUI EO instead of the TabsEl. 
- Eliminate the tabsElContextCreator. 

Old (na?):

The commandEl should be restructured to only call the Registered Elements
("CallerEl") through each elements natural parent ("ParentEl").

Currently the CommandEl calls the CallerEl directly. 

Goal: 
 - Get rid of the tabsElContextCreator that's currently required as the correct
   context will be available through the parent element
 - Should also solve the issue where the CallerEl needs to effect it's
   InputabilityChanges in the ParentEl

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  DONE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

01. translate tabs
01. translate scrollable pane (or work into the standard pane?) 
01. translate file_navigator

01. rewrite horizontal/vertical stack panes

05. Time Base Events. add a "future event" to a part of the EventResponse. In
    the future event there is a timestamp which says when this event should be
    activated. This can be triggered in the render loop and the event will then
    routed through the standard event loop as normal. This can be used to
    replicate a heartbeat for a element, or to simulate a visual effect such as
    a button click.

05. create builder types for each widget. 
     - annoying to send in the ctx and hat objects each time.
     - sometimes there are fields in the widget that are only 
       used for the creation of the widget, and not for the widget itself.
     - combine hat and ctx objects for widget creation. 

20. Add another cargo repo like AssertCmd for tui
     name: TuiTester?
     - https://github.com/aschey/tui-tester
     - what about https://github.com/microsoft/tui-test is this necessary?
     - open and record mouse and keystroke events
     - save only the final cui output
     - test for the final cui output being the same from
       the provided binary.
     - view what the output should look like
     - if a test is failing, but the output is correct but just changed
        there should be an option to quickly rerecord what the test should look
        like now.

30. refactor: remove ExtraLocations from EventResponse

05. Remove Refresh logic from Elements. currently when an element is destroyed
    or replaced, the parents call some Refresh logic, this should be removed in
    favour of specifically removing the priorities by the element id of the
    element being destroyed or replaced

05. Proper overwrite when writting a transparent character. Build in
    functionality to retrieve and draw what the content underneath should be
    even if it's not currently drawn will require new fn on Element
    "GetDrawingAtPos" as well as determining the layer order at a given
    position.

10. When the keyboard is matching an event combo provided to it, it should be
    recording a partial match (and a suggested maximum wait time to recheck for
    this match) whereby the caller can then make a choice given the associated
    priority to this combo whether to wait the time before checking for other
    matches or to ignore the wait and to proceed attempting to match the
    character in other ways.  

10. File navigator
    - ability to hide dotfiles ("ex. .git") navigator (toggle this functionality
      with Shift-i) 
    - scroll when the expansion exceeds element size (this logic is already in
     standard pane just needs to be hooked up)
    - save sub-folder expansion when a parent folder closes and then reopens. 
      - the folder keeps records of its navItems once they've been populated.
         - would need to "refresh" this list with each open could cause
           problems.
    - fix the up-dir (..) button
